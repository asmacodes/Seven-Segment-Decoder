# Seven-Segment Decoder using Logisim Evolution

Overview

This Logisim Evolution project is a seven-segment decoder. It takes a 4-bit binary input and displays the corresponding digit or character on a seven-segment display.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing and simulation.

Prerequisites
[Logisim Evolution]([url](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases)) - You'll need Logisim Evolution to open and simulate the circuit.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
Open Logisim Evolution.
Load the circuit by clicking "File" -> "Open" and selecting the .circ file from this repository.
Usage
Once you've loaded the circuit in Logisim Evolution, you can simulate it to see how the seven-segment decoder works.

Set the input values (A3, A2, A1, A0) to your desired 4-bit binary code.
Observe the seven-segment display to see the corresponding digit or character.
Circuit Design
The circuit is designed to map 4-bit binary inputs to the segments of a seven-segment display. The truth table and logic for each segment are implemented using basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT).

If you'd like to modify the circuit or understand how it works in detail, you can open the circuit file in Logisim Evolution and explore the components and connections.
